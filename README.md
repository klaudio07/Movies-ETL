# Movies-ETL

# Project Overview

 Learn how to use the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to create data pipelines.
 
# Goal

- Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.

- Extract data from disparate sources using Python.

- Clean and transform data using Pandas.

- Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.

- Load data with PostgreSQL.


# Deliverables

Use Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, write a function that reads in the three data files and creates three separate DataFrames

Use knowledge of Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, extract and transform the Wikipedia data so you can merge it with the Kaggle metadata. 

Extract and transform the Kaggle metadata and MovieLens rating data, then convert the transformed data into separate DataFrames. Then, youâ€™ll merge the Kaggle metadata DataFrame with the Wikipedia movies DataFrame to create the movies_df DataFrame.
